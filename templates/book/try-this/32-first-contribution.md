  # Try This: First Contribution

  Open Artifacts are modelled after the Open Source Software movement, and the tools that were developed for that community can be adapted to support cultural creators in making meaningful contributions to the world. One of the most popular tools used by open source communities is Github. For various reasons, I have chosen to use Github to host my repositories.

  In this exercise, you'll use two methods to contribute to an open artifacts project in Github. The first is to create an issue in the repository's issue tracker. In essence, this is letting the project maintainer know your idea but leaving it up to them to make the actual change.
  
  The second method is to create a pull request. I will recommend a great resource that can provide much better instructions that I can in many languages called First Contributions. If you decide to follow their tutorial, you can come back to our project and use the same sequence to create a change request on our repository.
