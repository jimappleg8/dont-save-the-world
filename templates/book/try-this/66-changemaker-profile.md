# Try This: Changemaker Profile

When you’re operating outside the normal system of accredited authority, you and the rest of the world may not have a clear idea of what you have to offer.

Therefore:
Trace your increasing capabilities by creating or updating your changemaker profile.

as you determine what’s Yours To Do, having a clear sense of who you are and what you can do is important.

A changemaker profile is a collection of information about you. It’s a bit like a resume or curriculum vitae (CV) in that it lists your experience and capabilities. It can be used by people you’re hoping to work with to help them get to know what you may have to offer, but it’s equally useful to you, as a way of tracking and monitoring your increasing capabilities.

Your profile can take whatever form you like, but we recommend:

**Timeline of projects.** List all the projects you’ve worked on, even self-created projects designed to help you learn something. If you’re proud of the work and you can remember something you gained from the experience, list it. This section is similar to a regular resume in that you list the project and the tasks you were responsible for.

**Lines of development.** This is an idea from Integral Theory where you graph out your relative capabilities in various lines of development. Ken Wilbur calls it a “psychograph.” I’d suggest one graph showing the three capabilities of sovereignty: sentience, intelligence, and agency. Use this chart to track if you are focusing on one or two aspects and work to rebalance so that all three are developing together.

**Practical Skills.** These are the Atlas/Notes/Practical Skills you’ve acquired. These don’t have to be business skills. If you can install a dishwasher, you should list it. Know how to do basic car maintenance? List it.

**Strengths and weaknesses.** You can either determine these yourself or you could send an email to friends asking what they think your strengths and weaknesses are. There are also formal tests you can take if you want to.

You might want too include information about your personality, like the results of a Myers Briggs test, but I’m not sure how relevant that will be. The reason for my hesitation is that there is growing evidence that our personalities are more malleable than we thought, and labelling yourself as an “introvert” or an “extrovert” may actually limit you in ways that don’t serve you. In short, personality assessments may be valuable, but I think you want to be careful what you (and others) learn from it.
